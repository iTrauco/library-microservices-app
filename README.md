# Library-Microservices-App
 
 A library microservices app built with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. 

 ### Purpose
This repo was created as a 'redo' for several past attempts to understand the processes, workflows, and technical concepts central to microservice-based application architecture with NoSQL databases and the 'serverless' API framework. 

[A formerly 'Private' version of this application has been shelved and made 'Public' for review. ](https://github.com/iTrauco/node-mongodb-microservice-app)

### Focus
After several weeks of in-depth study, I am rebuilding several previously created microservice and serverless applications from scratch with an emphasis on proper form, workflow, and security.

### Preview
The the only visual previews available for the various branches of this repo are concerned with TDD, if available, they will be included on the 'Summary/Overview' section of previously merged 'Pull Requests.'
