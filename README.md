# Node-Microservices-App
 
 A library microservice-architecture application built with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. 

 ### Purpose
This repo was created as a 'redo' of several past attempts to master the process, workflow, and concepts related to microservice architecture after several weeks of indepth study on the topic. 

[A formerly 'Private' version of this application has been archived and made 'Public' for review here. ](https://github.com/iTrauco/node-mongodb-microservice-app)

### Focus
After several weeks of study, my goal is to 'redo' my past attempts at microservice and serverless applications with a focus on security, form, and workflow.
